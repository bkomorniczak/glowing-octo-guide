## Development enviroment description:
In our development workflow, we leverage GitHub Actions as the foundation for our Continuous Integration (CI) process. The CI pipeline encompasses various tasks aimed at ensuring the reliability and quality of our codebase. The following key components are integral to our CI setup:
#### Gradle build task:
Our Gradle build task is a fundamental step in the CI process. Gradle is used to compile, assemble, and package our Java-based projects. This ensures that the code is correctly compiled and can be executed in the intended environment.
#### Gradle test task:
Testing is a crucial aspect of our development process, and the Gradle test task plays a pivotal role in this regard. We execute a comprehensive suite of tests to validate the functionality, performance, and reliability of our code. This task ensures that the application behaves as expected and that any changes introduced do not introduce regressions.
#### Super-Linter:
Maintaining a consistent and high-quality code style across our projects is vital. The Super-Linter is employed to analyze and enforce coding standards, ensuring uniformity in our codebase. This linter supports multiple languages, providing a comprehensive check for code quality and style adherence.
#### Trivy:
Security is a top priority in our development process. Trivy, a comprehensive vulnerability scanner for containers and applications, is integrated into our CI pipeline. It helps us identify and address potential security issues in dependencies, ensuring that our software is robust and resilient to security threats.

These components collectively contribute to a robust CI environment that promotes code reliability, consistency, and security throughout the development lifecycle. As we continue to evolve our processes, these tools play a crucial role in maintaining the high standards we set for our projects.
